clustalw-smp 0.99-9:

        * fixed solaris and irix makefiles to fix the floating precision
          problem (Irix cc will use radical optimizations that shuffle
          floating point operations if -O3 is used so the safe limit is with
          O2)
        * included a python script to run tests on the new clustalw-smp
        * included sequences to run tests on
        * included a README.test file to explain how to run the tests

clustalw-smp 0.99-8:

        * reverted to pth_measure.c and an older prfalign.c for
          speed/compatibility
        * passed Matt's tests
        * added CYGWIN support

clustalw-smp 0.99-7:

        * smp version is now clustalw 1.82 compliant
        * bug fix in pairalign.c due to random trashing of mm_score in
          parallel() - declared mm_score volatile
        * everything works finally as expected ;)

clustalw-smp 0.99-6:

        * various "fixes" thought related to the random mm_score trashing
          problem
          
clustalw-smp 0.99-5:

        * bug fix for prfalign.c pdiff() (roundoff error due to an unknown
          race condition)
        * prfscore() code inlined into pdiff_reverse() and pdiff_forward()
        * rewrote pdiff_reverse(), pdiff_forward() and pdiff() to utilize
          pool threading (reverted to 0.99-1 with fixups)
        * removed pth_measure.c and pth_measure.h as they are not needed any
          more

clustalw-smp 0.99-4:

        * inlined prfscore into pdiff_reverse() and pdiff_forward (this
          should save us some time)

clustalw-smp 0.99-2

        * added pth_measure.c to allow for measuring pthread_create
          peroformance
        * reverted to clustalw_smp 0.0.4 prfalign.c (doesnt break on linux
          IA-64 nor on Alpha. Considered stable.
        * fixed up new/old prfalign.c to use pth_measure.c

clustalw-smp 0.99-1

        * a major version leap
        * profiled the tool with dmalloc, fixed two memory leaks in
          pairalign.c

    -- Ognen Duzlevski <ognen@gene.pbi.nrc.ca>, Sat, Nov 3, 2001, 12:00

        * rewrote completely pairalign.c. Now the alignments are done by
          adding jobs to a queue of jobs to be done. There is one queue for
          each thread.
        
        * rewrote prfalign.c to use pooled threads
    
    -- Ognen Duzlevski <ognen@gene.pbi.nrc.ca>, Tue, Sep 4, 2001, 12:00

clustalw-smp 0.0.4

        * rewrote pairalign.c to utilize thread waiting for work to be done
        * rewrote prfalign.c to be OS sensitive
        
    -- Ognen Duzlevski <ognen@gene.pbi.nrc.ca>, July 2001
    
clustalw-smp 0.0.3

        * rewrote pairalign.c to utilize pooled threads
        
    -- Ognen Duzlevski <ognen@gene.pbi.nrc.ca>, June 2001
    
clustalw-smp 0.0.1

        * first version of pairalign.c creates threads as needed (results
          sometimes in a > 1024 threads running in the system
