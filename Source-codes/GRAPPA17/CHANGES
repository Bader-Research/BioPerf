Version 0.9 was the first public release of GRAPPA.
Version 1.0 improved input data handling, allowing, for instance,
  the use of taxon names with spaces in them.
Version 1.01 corrected an error in the constraint tree generation
  and improved the behavior of I/O under Windows.
Version 1.02 corrected the Nexus format printing of trees to use the
  proper distance method. Also improved error messages for reading
  the input file.
Several never-released versions introduced the EDE distance correction
  (version 1.1, now option -e), a tighter circular bound (version 1.2,
  now option -m), a different search ordering (layered search, version 1.3,
  now option -l), true inversion medians (version 1.4, now options in the
  choice of median solver), and a limited branch-and-bound elimination of
  low-level subtrees (version 1.5, now option -a).
Version 1.6 releases all of the additions and improvements of versions
  1.1 through 1.5.  All changes made by Jijun Tang, with inversion median
  codes contributed by Alberto Caprara and by Adam Siepel.
