If you follow the steps below, CE should work:

- extract the file  "ce_linux.tar.gz" with 
	gunzip ce_linux.tar.gz
	tar -xvf ce_linux.tar

This  will create a directory "ce_dist"

- goto directory ce_distr/pdb/

-copy and extract the file named "pdb.1303.tar.gz" into "ce_distr/pdb/"

-go to the directory "ce_dist".

-now you are ready to run a sample CE query. Try the following line 

	./CE - pdb/1LH1.pdb - pdb/1GDL.pdb - scratch > /dev/null

This runs CE without displaying result. If you say 

	./CE - pdb/1LH1.pdb - pdb/1GDL.pdb - scratch 

then you can see the results. 

-you can run the queries in file "execute" as the benchmark.
