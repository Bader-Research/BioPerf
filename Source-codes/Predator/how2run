This file shows how to run predator on the example of the FIS protein and
related proteins found in the SWISSPROT database by a FASTA search. See
documentation for details.

1) predator -h 3fis.seq

Sice -u option has not been specified, PREDATOR will find the FIS
protein in its sequence/structure database and will simply use the
known assignment as prediction.

2) predator -h 3fis.seq -u

A genuine prediction will be generated for the first sequence in the
set (3fis) using other sequences.

3) predator -h 3fis.seq -s -u

A genuine prediction will be generated for the first sequence in the
set (3fis) without using other sequences (single sequence prediction)


If PREDATOR has not been installed properly and you just want to try
it quickly after unpacking, you will have to specify all file paths explicitely:

e.g., for SGI:

../exe/irix.exe -h -b../exe/stride.dat 3fis.seq
