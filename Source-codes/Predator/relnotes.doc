1. Exacutables for UNIX are no longer supplied
2. Reading MSF files corrected
3. Several serious bugs fixed
4. PREDATOR made 20-40% faster
5. Bug fixed: with -a and -fFileName options (predict secondary structure for all sequences
   and write the results to the file FileName) only the last prediction appeared in the
   output file since it was open for writing. Now it has been changed to appending and all
   predictions are correctly output.
