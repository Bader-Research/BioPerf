       1.  About the method


       PREDATOR	[1,2] is a secondary structure prediction program.  It	takes
       as  input  a single protein sequence to be predicted and	can optimally
       use a set of unaligned sequences	as additional information to  predict
       the  query  sequence.  The mean prediction accuracy of PREDATOR is 68%
       for a single sequence and 75% for a set of related sequences. PREDATOR
       does  not  use  multiple	 sequence  alignment.  Instead,	 it relies on
       careful pairwise	local alignments of the	sequences in the set with the
       query   sequence	to  be predicted. If you supply	a set of sequences in
       the form	of a  multiple alignment  in  CLUSTAL or  MSF	format,	  the
       sequences will be used but as unaligned.

       Below follow the	abstracts of the papers	describing the method.

       Prediction from a single	sequence [1]:

       "Existing approaches to protein secondary  structure  prediction	 from
       the  amino  acid	 sequence usually rely on statistics of	local residue
       interactions within a sliding  window  and  the secondary   structural
       state  of the central residue. The practically achieved accuracy	limit
       of such single residue and single sequence prediction methods is	about
       65% in three structural states (a-helix,	b-strand, and coil).  Further
       improvement  in the  prediction	quality	   is  likely	to    require
       exploitation   of   various   aspects   of  three-dimensional  protein
       architecture. Here we make such an attempt  and present	an   accurate
       algorithm  for  secondary structure prediction based on recognition of
       potentially hydrogen-bonded residues in the amino acid  sequence.  The
       unique	feature	of our approach	involves data-base derived statistics
       on residue type occurrences  in different  classes  of  b-bridges   to
       delineate  interacting  b-strands.   The	a-helical structures are also
       recognized on the basis of amino	acid occurrences  in  hydrogen-bonded
       pairs   (i,i+4).	The  algorithm has a prediction	accuracy 68% in	three
       structural states on only a  single  protein  sequence, and  has	  the
       potential  to  be improved by 5-7% if homologous	aligned	sequences are
       also considered".

       Prediction from a set of	sequences [2]:

       "In this	work we	present	an accurate  secondary structure   prediction
       procedure  for a	query sequence with related sequences. The most	novel
       aspect of our approach is its reliance on pairwise alignments  of  the
       related sequences rather	than utilization of a multiple alignment. The
       residue-by-residue accuracy of the method is 75%	in  three  structural
       states  after  jack-knife  tests.  The  gain  in	 prediction  accuracy
       compared	to the existing	techniques (which are near 72%)	 is  achieved
       by  better  secondary  structure	propensities for individual sequences
       which  account  for  long-range effects,	 utilization  of   homologous
       information   in	the  from  of  carefully  selected pairwise alignment
       fragments, and reliance on a much larger	collection of protein primary
       structures.  The	 method	 is  especially	 appropriate  for large-scale
       sequence	analysis efforts,  such	 as  genome  characterization,	where
       precise	and   significant  multiple  alignments	are  not available or
       achievable".

       3.  Availability


       PREDATOR	exists for UNIX	and  DOS.  Documentation,   data   files  and
       source  code  are  available  by	 anonymous  FTP	  from	ftp.ebi.ac.uk
       (directories				 /pub/software/unix/predator,
       /pub/software/dos/predator).  A	DOS  executable	 is  also  available.
       Protein sequences  can be submitted for secondary structure prediction
       either		to	    WWW		URL	     http://www.embl-
       heidelberg.de/predator/predator_info.html  or  through electronic mail
       to predator@embl-heidelberg.de. A mail message containing HELP in  the
       first line will be answered with	appropriate instructions.



       4.  Installation


       The program is supplied with  two  database  files  -  stride.dat  and
       dssp.dat	  -  which  contain  propensity	tables,	 secondary structural
       assignments and thresholds for two assignment methods - STRIDE [3] and
       DSSP  [4].  One of these	files is read by the program every time	it is
       started.	The environment	variable PRE_DIR has to	contain	the  name  of
       the directory in	which the files	are located. For example, if you work
       under UNIX in csh, you will have	to include the following statement in
       your .cshrc file:

	      setenv PRE_DIR	     /your/directory/with/these/files

       In DOS, your autoexec.bat file has to contain the following statement:

		 set PRE_DIR=disk:\your\directory\with\these\files

       If the variable PRE_DIR is not set, PREDATOR will look for  the	files
       stride.dat   and	dssp.dat   in  the  current  directory.	 You can also
       explicitly specify the location of the database file using the  option
       -b (see below).


       5.  Input


       PREDATOR	takes as input a sequence  file	 in  FASTA,  MSF  or  CLUSTAL
       format	containing  one	or  many  protein  sequences. By default, the
       prediction will be made for the first sequence in the set. This can be
       changed	using  the  options  -i	or -a (see below). Fasta format	looks
       like this:

       > One line description of the first sequence (the first word  will  be
       used as sequence	id)
       HGFSADSAREYPLKSASDSDA
       ERYTARWFDSGHKLNXMMS
       > One line description of the second sequence
       RYTSGFHAWQWDMNKLBNSSS
       etc

       The ability to read MSF and CLUSTAL formats is added for	 convenience.
       The actual multiple alignment will not be used.



       6.  Using PREDATOR


       The only	required parameter for PREDATOR	 is  the  name of  the	 file
       containing  a  protein sequence or a set	of sequences in	FASTA, MSF or
       CLUSTAL format. By default PREDATOR writes to standard  output;	i.e.,
       your  screen.  On systems that allow to redirect	output,	you can	do so
       to create a disk	file. Help is available	if  you	 just  type  PREDATOR
       without parameters. The following options are accepted.

       General options

       -fFilename     write output to the  file	 "Filename"  rather  than  to
		      stdout.

       -l	      long output form,	in which every output  line  contains
		      residue	number,	three-letter residue name, one-letter
		      residue name, predicted secondary	structural state  and
		      reliability  estimate.  If  a  STRIDE or DSSP secondary
		      structure	assignment has been read (options -x and  -y,
		      see  below), the known assignment	will also be shown in
		      the output for comparison. By default the	short  output
		      form is used.

       -o	      output sequence(s) and die

       -h	      indicate progress	by dots	and output  other  additional
		      information if available.


       Selection of sequences to predict

       -a	      make prediction for All sequences	in the input file

       -iSeqId	      make prediction for the sequence SeqId

       By default prediction is	made for the first sequence in the set

       Prediction options

       -s	      perform  single  sequence	 prediction.	Ignore	other
		      sequences	in the set.

       -r	      preserve the original alignment in the CLUSTAL  or  MSF
		      file (do not unalign) /*Not implemented yet!*/

       -u	      Do not copy assignment directly from the PDB   database
		      if   query   sequence  is	found in PDB. By default, the
		      known conformation of 7-residue segments will  be	 used
		      if   they	are  identical to a 7-residue fragment in the
		      query sequence.

       -d	      use DSSP target assignment  (default  is STRIDE).	  The
		      predictions    made   with   DSSP	 and   STRIDE  target
		      assignments   are	  optimized    to    reproduce	these
		      assignments as well as possible.

       -bFilename     use database file	FileName

       Comparison with the known assignment (for testing):

       -xFileName     read STRIDE file

       -yFileName     read DSSP	file

       -zChain	      PDB Chain	(must be specified if option  -x  or  -y  are
		      used)

       Additional functions:

       -nPercentId    find a subset of sequences with no more than  PercentId
		      identity between any pair	of sequences (quick and	dirty
		      algorithm)

       All options are case- and position-insensitive. Sequence	names (option
       -i) are case sensitive.

       Examples:

	 1.  Predict secondary structure for the single	sequence globin.seq

				   predator  globin.seq

	 2.  Predict secondary structure  for the  first  sequence   in	  the
	     multiple sequence file globins.seq

				  predator  globins.seq

	 3.  Predict  secondary	 structure  of the  first  sequence  in	  the
	     multiple	alignment  file	globins.aln.  Create  long output and
	     write it in the file globins.pred

			  predator -l globins.aln -fglobins.pred

	 4.  Predict secondary structure of the	sequence  glob_ecoli  in  the
	     multiple alignment	file globins.aln

			    predator globins.aln -iGLOB_ECOLI

	 5.  Read sequence from	 the  file  5ruba.seq, make  prediction	  and
	     compare   it  with	the known assignment for the chain A from the
	     file 5rub.str.

			    predator 5ruba.seq -x5rub.str -za

       NOTE: chain " " must be specified as "-"; e.g. -z-



       7.  Output


       Short output form:

       Secondary structure states of amino acids are indicated by the letters
       "H" (helix), "E"	(extended or sheet), and "_" (coil).

       Long output form:

       Secondary structure states of amino acids are indicated by letters "H"
       or   "h"	(helix),  "E"  or  "e" (extended), and "C" or "c" (coil). The
       prediction is shown in lower case except	for those residues for	which
       the assignment was directly copied from the PDB database. This feature
       is added	so that	you can	distinguish between the	predictions  actually
       made by PREDATOR	and those taken	from known structures.

       The  prediction is  contained  in  the records  beginning   with	  the
       identifier PRED in the first columns. For each amino acid site of your
       sequence,  residue  number,  three-  and	  one-letter   residue	code,
       prediction,  reliability	 estimate,  and	 the  number of	residues from
       related sequences  projected  onto  this	 residue  through  the	local
       alignment  procedure are	shown in subsequent columns. Additionally, if
       the STRIDE or DSSP assignments have been	read using the options -x  or
       -y  (and	 -z), the last column of the PREDATOR output will contain the
       actual  secondary  structural  assignment  for  your  sequence  if  it
       corresponds  exactly  to	 the  one  in  the  STRIDE  or DSSP file (for
       comparison). If the known assignment is not available,  i.e.,  if  you
       did not use the -x or -y	options, question signs	will be	output.

       Both output forms:

       If option -h has	been used, PREDATOR will show  progress	 by  printing
       dots  on	 the  standard output. If your sequence	has related sequences
       with known 3D structure,	PDB identifiers	of these  sequences  will  be
       printed.



       8.  Practical considerations



	 1.  For long sequences	and large sequence sets	PREDATOR can be	slow.
	     It	 is recommended	to use the option -h to	monitor	its progress.
	     Note that some of the sequence identifiers	  will	 be   skipped
	     if	 there	are  no	significant local alignments between them and
	     the query sequence. On the	other  hand,   some   sequences	  can
	     appear more than once if there are	several	local alignments.  If
	     you need a	prediction for only one	sequence in the	 set,  do not
	     use   the	 -a  option  as	 it  may  significantly	slow down the
	     computation. In this case PREDATOR	will calculate full secondary
	     structure	propensities  for all sequence in the set rather than
	     just for selected pieces significantly aligned  with  the	query
	     sequence.	 On the	other hand, if you really need	a  prediction
	     for  all sequences, it is more  time-efficient  to	 use  the  -a
	     option rather than	running	PREDATOR on each sequence in the  set
	     at	 a  time since	in this	 case  all  propensities  have	to be
	     calculated	anyway.

	 2.  If	some sequences in the set  have	 no  fragments	significantly
	     related  to  the  query  sequence,	they will not be used for the
	     prediction.  Thus,	 it  is	 NOT  a	 problem  to  have  unrelated
	     sequences in your sequence	set.

	 3.  The quality of the	prediction depends dramatically	on the number
	     of	  sequences   in the  set.  The	more sequence information you
	     provide, the better results  you  will  get.  Therefore,  it  is
	     strongly recommended to perform a sensitive sequence search with
	     your sequence against the largest sequence	database available to
	     extract  as  many related sequences as you	can. For example, the
	     FASTA program with	ktuple=1  gives	 good  results.	 The  largest
	     collections  of  protein  sequences  (about  160000 entries) are
	     currently	TREMBL	and  GENPEPT.	The   following	  steps	  are
	     recommended.  a)  Run   a	 database   search  with  your single
	     sequence against a	large sequence database. b) Make the  set  of
	     sequences	extracted  as  a result	of the	database search	 non-
	     redundant such  that  no  two  sequences  share  more  than  95%
	     sequence identity (e.g., predator -n95 filename).	c) Merge your
	     search  sequence	with  the  resulting  non-redundant  set.  d)
	     Perform  secondary	 structure  prediction.	  You can submit your
	     sequence for prediction  to  the  WWW  or	e-mail	server	 (see
	     availability)  where  all these steps will	be done	automatically
	     for you.

	 4.  If	 the  -l  option  is  specified,  PREDATOR  will  output  the
	     reliability     index    for    each   residue   predicted.   In
	     general,  reliability  values   higher   then    0.8    indicate
	     sequence	sites  predicted  at   about  90%  accuracy.  If  the
	     prediction	reliability for	a  given  residue  equals  zero,   it
	     does    not    mean    that    the	 prediction   is   completely
	     unreliable.  It means that	there was insufficient statistics  to
	     derive  the  reliability  for  the	 set  of  secondary structure
	     propensities associated with this residue;	i.e., the reliability
	     is	 unknown. Less	than  10%  of  residues	generally do not have
	     a	reliability  estimate.	Sequence  fragments   with   atypical
	     composition   (e.g.,   "asfasfasfasfasaf"	 )   will    have  no
	     reliability estimate as well as short  proteins  (less  then  50
	     amino acids) where	statistics are scarce.

	 5.  If	your sequence has a closely related  protein  with  known  3D
	     structure,	the secondary structure	prediction of every 7-residue
	     fragment in your sequence identical with the PDB  sequence	 will
	     be	   substituted	  by	the    known	tertiary   structural
	     assignments.  PREDATOR currently relies on	a database of 556 PDB
	     chains   with pairwise  identity  no  higher  than	 30%.  Please
	     note that no additional filtering	of  the	 prediction  is	 made
	     after   this   such  that	 it   can   contain,   for  instance,
	     helices  of length	one.  Related PDB structures will be reported
	     if	  the	option	-h  was	specified. To avoid this substitution
	     (for example for testing),	use the	option -u.
