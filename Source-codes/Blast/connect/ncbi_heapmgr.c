 *
 * Abstract:
 *
 * This is a simple heap manager with a primitive garbage collection.
 * The heap contains blocks of data, stored in the common contiguous pool,
 * each block preceded with a SHEAP_Block structure.  Low word of 'flag'
 * is either non-zero (True), when the block is in use, or zero (False),
 * when the block is vacant.  'Size' shows the length of the block in bytes,
 * (uninterpreted) data field of which is extended past the header
 * (the header size IS counted in the size of the block).
 *
 * When 'HEAP_Alloc' is called, the return value is either a heap pointer,
 * which points to the block header, marked as allocated and guaranteed
 * to have enough space to hold the requested data size; or 0 meaning, that the
 * heap has no more room to provide such a block (reasons for that:
 * heap is corrupted, heap has no provision to be expanded, expansion failed,
 * or the heap was attached read-only).
 *
 * An application program can then use the data field on its need,
 * providing not to overcome the size limit.  The current block header
 * can be used to find the next heap block with the use of 'size' member
 * (note, however, some restrictions below).
 *
 * The application program is NOT assumed to keep the returned block pointer,
 * as the garbage collection can occur on the next allocation attempt,
 * thus making any heap pointers invalid.  Instead, the application program
 * can keep track of the heap base (header of the very first heap block -
 * see 'HEAP_Create'), and the size of the heap, and can traverse the heap by
 * this means, or with call to 'HEAP_Walk' (described below). 
 *
 * While traversing, if the block found is no longer needed, it can be freed
 * with 'HEAP_Free' call, supplying the address of the block header
 * as an argument.
 *
 * Prior the heap use, the initialization is required, which comprises
 * call to either 'HEAP_Create' or 'HEAP_Attach' with the information about
 * the base heap pointer. 'HEAP_Create' also requires the size of initial
 * heap area (if there is one), and size of chunk (usually, a page size)
 * to be used in heap expansions (defaults to alignment if provided as 0).
 * Additionally (but not compulsory) the application program can provide
 * heap manager with 'expand' routine, which is supposed to be called,
 * when no more room is available in the heap, or the heap was not
 * preallocated (base = 0 in 'HEAP_Create'), and given the arguments:
 * - current heap base address (or 0 if this is the very first heap alloc),
 * - new required heap size (or 0 if this is the very last call to deallocate
 * the entire heap). 
 * If successful, the expand routine must return the new heap base
 * address (if any) of expanded heap area, and where the exact copy of
 * the current heap is made.
 *
 * Note that all heap base pointers must be aligned on a 'double' boundary.
 * Please also be warned not to store pointers to the heap area, as a
 * garbage collection can clobber them. Within a block, however,
 * it is possible to use local pointers (offsets), which remain same
 * regardless of garbage collections.
 *
 * For automatic traverse purposes there is a 'HEAP_Walk' call, which returns
 * the next block (either free, or used) from the heap.  Given a NULL-pointer,
 * this function returns the very first block, whereas all subsequent calls
 * with the argument being the last observed block results in the next block 
 * returned. NULL comes back when no more blocks exist in the heap.
 *
 * Note that for proper heap operations, no allocations should happen between
 * successive calls to 'HEAP_Walk', whereas deallocation of the seen block
 * is okay.
 *
 * Explicit heap traversing should not overcome the heap limit,
 * as any information above the limit is not maintained by the heap manager.
 * Every heap operation guarantees, that there are no adjacent free blocks,
 * only used blocks can follow each other sequentially.
 *
 * To discontinue to use the heap, 'HEAP_Destroy' or 'HEAP_Detach' can be
 * called. The former deallocates the heap (by means of a call to 'expand'),
 * the latter just removes the heap handle, retaining the heap data intact.
 * Later, such a heap could be used again if attached with 'HEAP_Attach'.
 *
 * Note that attached heap is in read-only mode, that is nothing can be
 * allocated and/or freed in that heap, as well as an attempt to call
 * 'HEAP_Destroy' will not destroy the heap data.
 *
 * Note also, that 'HEAP_Create' always does heap reset, that is the
 * memory area pointed by 'base' (if not 0) gets reformatted and lose
 * all previous contents.

 * HEAP_AttachEx: size_t -> TNCBI_Size per prototype (needed on 64-bit archs)
 *
 * Revision 6.24  2003/09/23 21:06:30  lavr
 * +HEAP_AttachEx()
 *
 * Revision 6.23  2003/08/28 21:09:58  lavr
 * Accept (and allocate) additional heap extent in HEAP_CopySerial()
 *
 * Revision 6.22  2003/08/25 16:53:37  lavr
 * Add/remove spaces here and there to comply with coding rules...
 *
 * Revision 6.21  2003/08/25 16:47:08  lavr
 * Fix in pointer arith since the base changed from "char*" to "void*"
 *
 * Revision 6.20  2003/08/25 14:50:50  lavr
 * Heap arena ptrs changed to be "void*";  expand routine to take user arg
 *
 * Revision 6.19  2003/08/11 19:08:04  lavr
 * HEAP_Attach() reimplemented via HEAP_AttachEx() [not public yet]
 * HEAP_Trim() fixed to call expansion routine where applicable
 *
 * Revision 6.18  2003/07/31 17:54:03  lavr
 * +HEAP_Trim()
 *
 * Revision 6.17  2003/03/24 19:45:15  lavr
 * Added few minor changes and comments
 *
 * Revision 6.16  2002/08/16 15:37:22  lavr
 * Warn if allocation attempted on a NULL heap

 * Revision 6.13  2001/07/31 15:07:58  lavr
 * Added paranoia log message: freeing a block in a NULL heap
 *
 * Revision 6.12  2001/07/13 20:09:27  lavr
 * If remaining space in a block is equal to block header,
 * do not leave this space as a padding of the block been allocated,
 * but instead form a new block consisting only of the header.
 * The block becomes a subject for a later garbage collecting.
 *
 * Revision 6.11  2001/07/03 20:24:03  lavr
 * Added function: HEAP_Copy()
 *
 * Revision 6.10  2001/06/25 15:32:41  lavr
