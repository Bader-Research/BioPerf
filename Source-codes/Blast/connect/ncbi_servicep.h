/* Modified 'fast track' routine for obtaining of a service info in one-shot.
 * Please see <connect/ncbi_service.h> for explanations [SERV_GetInfoEx()].
 * For now, this call is to exclusively support MYgethostbyname() replacement
 * of standard gethostbyname() libcall in Apache Web daemon (see in daemons/).
 *
 * CAUTION: unlike "service" parameter, "arg" and "val" are not copied from,
 *          but the orignal pointers get stored -- take this into account
 *          while dealing with dynamically allocated strings in the slow
 *          "iterator" version of the call below -- the pointers must remain
 *          valid as long as the iterator stays open (i.e. until SERV_Close()).
 *
 * NOTE: Preference 0.0 does not prohibit the preferred_host to be selected;
 *       nor preference 100.0 ultimately opts for the preferred_host; rather,
 *       the preference is considered as an estimate for the selection
 *       probability when all other conditions for favoring the host are
 *       optimal, i.e. preference 0.0 actually means not to favor the preferred
 *       host at all, while 100.0 means to opt for that as much as possible.
