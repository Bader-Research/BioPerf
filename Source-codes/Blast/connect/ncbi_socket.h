 *  Multi-Thread safety
 *
 * If you are using this API in a multi-thread application, and there is

 * threads, and to call SOCK_ShutdownAPI() after all threads are exited.

 * you still must not operate with the same LSOCK or SOCK objects from
 * different threads simultaneously.
 *
 * A MUCH BETTER WAY of dealing with this issue is to provide your own MT
 * locking callback (see CORE_SetLOCK in "ncbi_core.h"). This will also

 *                    the socket (so that the next read operation will see the
 *                    data again), with one important exception noted below.
 * eIO_ReadPersist -- read exactly "size" bytes and return eIO_Success; if less
 *                    data received then return an error condition (including
 *                    eIO_Timeout).
 *
 * If there is no data available to read (also, if eIO_ReadPersist and cannot
 * read exactly "size" bytes) and the timeout(see SOCK_SetTimeout) is expired
 * then return eIO_Timeout.
 *
 * Both eIO_ReadPlain and eIO_ReadPeek return eIO_Success iff some data have
 * been read (perhaps within the time allowance specified by eIO_Read timeout).
 * Both mothods return any other code when no data at all were available.
 * eIO_ReadPersist differs from the other two methods as it can return an
 * error condition even if some data were actually obtained from the socket.
 * Hence, as a rule of thumb, an application should always check the number
 * of read bytes BEFORE checking the return status, which merely advises
 * whether it is okay to read again.
 *
 * As a special case, "buf" may passed as NULL:
 *   eIO_ReadPeek      -- read up to "size" bytes and store them
 *                        in internal buffer;
 *   eIO_Read[Persist] -- discard up to "size" bytes from internal buffer
 *                        and socket (check "*n_read" to know how many).
 *
 * NOTE1: "Read" and "peek" methods differ:  if "read" is performed and not
 *        enough but some data available immediately from the internal buffer,

/******************************************************************************
 *  Connectionless (datagram) sockets
 *
 *  How the datagram exchange API works:
 *
 *  Datagram socket is created with special DSOCK_Create[Ex] calls but the
 *  resulting object is a SOCK handle. That is, almost all SOCK routines
 *  may be applied to the handle. There are few exceptions, though.
 *  In datagram sockets I/O differs from how it is done in stream sockets:
 *
 *  SOCK_Write() writes data into an internal message buffer, appending new
 *  data as they come with each SOCK_Write(). When the message is complete,
 *  SOCK_SendMsg() should be called (optionally with additional last,
 *  or the only [if no SOCK_Write() preceded the call] message fragment)
 *  to actually send the message down the wire. If successful, SOCK_SendMsg()
 *  cleans the internal buffer, and the process may repeat. If unsuccessful,
 *  SOCK_SendMsg() can be repeated with restiction that no additional data are
 *  provided in the call. This way, the entire message will be attempted to
 *  be sent again. On the other hand, if after any SOCK_SendMsg() new data
 *  are added [regardless of whether previous data were successfully sent
 *  or not], all previously written [and kept in the internal send buffer]
 *  data get dropped and replaced with the new data.
 *
 *  DSOCK_WaitMsg() can be used to learn whether there is a new message
 *  available for read by DSOCK_RecvMsg() immediately.
 *
 *  SOCK_RecvMsg() receives the message into an internal receive buffer,
 *  and optionally can return the initial datagram fragment via provided
 *  buffer [this initial fragment is then stripped from what remains unread
 *  in the internal buffer]. Optimized version can supply a maximal message
 *  size (if known in advance), or 0 to get a message of any allowed size.
 *  The actual size of the received message can be obtained via a
 *  pointer-type argument 'msgsize'. The message kept in the internal buffer
 *  can be read out in several SOCK_Read() calls, last returning eIO_Closed,
 *  when all data have been taken out. SOCK_Wait() returns eIO_Success while
 *  there are data in the internal message buffer that SOCK_Read() can read.
 *
 *  SOCK_WipeMsg() can be used to clear the internal message buffers in
 *  either eIO_Read or eIO_Write directions, meaning receive and send
 *  buffers correspondingly.
