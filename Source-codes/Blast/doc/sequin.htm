<b><i>Introduction</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
Sequin is a stand-alone software tool developed by the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for submitting and updating sequences to the
GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ databases. Sequin has the capacity to handle long
sequences and sets of sequences (segmented entries, as well as population,
phylogenetic, and mutation studies). It also allows sequence editing and
updating, and provides complex annotation capabilities. In addition, Sequin
contains a number of built-in validation functions for enhanced quality
assurance.

<p align="justify">
This overview is intended to provide a quick guide to Sequin's capabilities,
including automatic annotation of coding regions, the graphical viewer,
quality control features, and editing features. We suggest that you read this
entire document before beginning your Sequin submission. More detailed
instructions on these and other functions can be found in Sequin's on-screen
<b>Help</b> file, also available on the World-Wide Web from the Sequin
homepage at:

<p align="left">
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/">
<tt>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/</tt></a>

<p align="justify">
Email help is also available from

<p align="left">
<font size=4>
<b><i>Basic Sequin Organization</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
Sequin is organized into a series of forms to (1) enter submitting authors,
(2) enter organism and sequences, (3) enter information such as strain, gene,
and protein names, (4) view the complete submission, and (5) edit and annotate
the submission. The goal is to go quickly from raw sequence data to an
assembled record that can be viewed, edited, and submitted to your database of
choice.

<p align="justify">
Advance through the pages that make up each form by clicking on labeled
folder tabs or the <b>Next Page</b> button. After the basic information forms
have been completed and the sequence data imported, Sequin provides a complete
view of your submission, in your choice of text or graphic format. At this
point, any of the information fields can be easily modified by double-clicking
on any area of the record, and additional biological annotations can be
entered by selecting from a menu.

<p align="justify">
Sequin has an on-screen <b>Help</b> file that is opened automatically when you
start the program. Because it is context sensitive, the <b>Help</b> text will
change and follow your steps as you progress through the program. A
&quot;Find&quot; function is also provided.

<b><i>Before You Begin</i></b>
</font>
</a>

<p align="left">
<b>Preparing Nucleotide and Amino Acid Data</b>

<p align="justify">
Sequin normally expects to read sequence files in FASTA format. Note that most
sequence analysis software packages include FASTA or &quot;raw&quot; as one of
the available output formats. Population, phylogenetic, and mutation studies
can also be entered in PHYLIP, NEXUS, MACAW, or FASTA+GAP formats.

<p align="justify">
See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/faq.html#Orgnameforphyl">
<tt>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/faq.html#Orgnameforphyl</tt></a>
or &quot;<a HREF="#formatexamples">Sample Data Files</a>&quot;
for detailed examples of each of the various input data formats.

<p align="justify">
Prepare your sequence data files using a text editor, and save in ASCII text
format (plain text). If your nucleotide sequence encodes one or more protein
products, Sequin expects two files, one for the nucleotides and one for the
proteins.

<p align="justify">
FASTA format is simply the raw sequence preceded by a definition line. The
definition line begins with a > sign and is followed immediately by a name
for the sequence (your own local identification code, or local ID) and a
title. During the submission process, indexing staff at the database to which
you are submitting will change your local ID to an Accession number. You can
embed other important information in the title, and Sequin uses this
information to construct a record. Specifically, you can enter organism and
strain or clone information in the nucleotide definition line and gene and
protein information in the protein definition line. Examples for the
nucleotide and protein files are shown here:

<pre>
>eIF4E [organism=Drosophila melanogaster] [strain=Oregon R] Drosophila ...
CGGTTGCTTGGGTTTTATAACATCAGTCAGTGACAGGCATTTCCAGAGTTGCCCTGTTCA ...

>4E-I [gene=eIF4E] [protein=eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-I]
MQSDFHRMKNFANPKSMFKTSAPSTEQGRPEPPTSAAAPAEAKDVKPKEDPQETGEPAGN ...
>4E-II [gene=eIF4E] [protein=eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-II]
MVVLETEKTSAPSTEQGRPEPPTSAAAPAEAKDVKPKEDPQETGEPAGNTATTTAPAGDD ...
</pre>

<p align="justify">
The ability to embed this information in the definition line is provided as a
convenience to the submitter. If these annotations are not present, they can
be entered in subsequent forms. Sequin is designed to use this information,
and that provided in the initial forms, to build a properly structured record.
<b>In many cases, the final submission can be completely prepared from these
data, so that no additional manual annotation is necessary once the record is
displayed.</b>

<p align="justify">
See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/faq.html#Biosrcmod">
<tt>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/faq.html#Biosrcmod</tt></a>
for a complete list of definition line modifiers.

<p align="justify">
In this example, we show alternative splicing, where a single gene produces
multiple messenger RNAs that encode two similar but distinct protein products.

<p align="justify">
Note that the [ and ] brackets actually appear in the text. (Brackets are
sometimes used in computer documentation to denote optional text. This
convention is not followed here.) The bracketed information will be removed
from the definition line for each sequence. Sequin can also calculate a new
definition line by computing on features in the annotated record
(see &quot;<a HREF="#autodefline">Generating the Definition Line</a>&quot;).

<p align="justify">
Also, please note that there must be a line break (carriage return) between
the definition line and the first line of sequence. Some word processors will
break a single line onto two lines without actually adding a carriage return.
(This feature is known as "word wrapping".) If you are unsure whether there is
a carriage return, you can either set up your word processor so it shows
invisible characters like carriage returns, or view the file in a text editor
that does not create artificial line breaks. <b>The definition line itself
must not have a line break within it, because the second line would then be
misinterpreted as the beginning of the sequence data.</b> The actual sequence
is usually broken every 50 to 80 characters, but this is not necessary for
Sequin to be able to read it.

<p align="left">
<b>Segmented Nucleotide Sets</b>

<p align="justify">
A segmented nucleotide entry is a set of non-contiguous sequences that has a
defined order and orientation. For example, a genomic DNA segmented set could
include encoding exons along with fragments of their flanking introns. An
example of an mRNA segmented pair of records would be the 5' and 3' ends of an
mRNA, where the middle region has not been sequenced. To import nucleotides in
a segmented set, each individual sequence must be in FASTA format with an
appropriate definition line, and all sequences should be in the same file. The
file containing the sequences is imported into Sequin as described later.

<p align="left">
<b>Population, Phylogenetic, or Mutation Studies</b>

<p align="justify">
For phylogenetic studies, the scientific name of each organism should be
encoded in each FASTA definition line, e.g., [organism=Mus musculus]. For
population studies, you can encode strain, clone, and isolate information in
the definition line, e.g., [strain=BALB/c]. For these studies, PHYLIP, NEXUS,
MACAW, and FASTA+GAP formats
(see &quot;<a HREF="#formatexamples">Sample Data Files</a>&quot;) can also be
read. (All of these formats require a unique sequence identifier, i.e., a
local ID.) A sample FASTA+GAP file for a phylogenetic study is shown here:

<pre>

</pre>

<p align="justify">
One could add &quot;28S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence&quot; as a title
to all sequences using the <b>Annotation</b> page of the <b>Organism and
Sequences</b> form, and could also ask that the correct organism name be
prefixed to each title. (Sequin will convert the U (uracil) characters into T
(thymine) automatically.)

<p align="left">
<b>Sets of Segmented Sequences</b>

<p align="justify">
If the sequences in a phylogenetic study are really segmented (e.g., ITS1 and
ITS2 of ribosomal RNA without the intervening 5.8S rRNA sequence), the
individual segments from a single organism can be grouped within square
brackets. Subsequent segments are detected by the presence of a FASTA
definition line. For example:

<pre>
[
>QruITS1 [organism=Quercus rubra]
CGAAAACCTGCACAGCAGAAACGACTCGCAAACTAGTAATAACTGACGGAGGACGGAGGG ...
>QruITS2
CATCATTGCCCCCCATCCTTTGGTTTGGTTGGGTTGGAAGTTCACCTCCCATATGTGCCC ...
]
[

>QsuITS2
CATCGTTGCCCCCCTTCTTTGGTTTGGTTGGGTTGGAAGTTGGCCTTCCATATGTGCCCT ...
]
...
</pre>

<p align="justify">
FASTA+GAP format can also use this convention for encoding sets of segmented
sequences.

<b>Creating a Submission</b>
</font>
</a>

<p align="justify">
The sequence data we will use for this example is the genomic sequence of the
Drosophila melanogaster eukaryotic initiation factors 4E-I and 4E-II (GenBank
Accession number U54469).

<p align="left">
<font size=4>
<b><i>Welcome to Sequin Form</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
Once you have finished preparing the sequence files, you are ready to start
the Sequin program. Sequin's first window asks you to indicate the database to
which the sequence will be submitted and prompts you to start a new project
or continue with an existing one. Once you choose a database, Sequin will
remember it in subsequent sessions. In general, each sequence submission
should be entered as a separate project. However, segmented DNA sequences,
population studies, phylogenetic studies, and mutation studies should be
submitted together as one project. This feature also eliminates the need to
save Sequin information templates for each sequence.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn01.png" align=bottom alt="Welcome to Sequin form has
push buttons to Start New Submission, Read Existing Record, Show Help, and

<br>

<p align="justify">
See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/netaware.html">
<tt>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/netaware.html</tt></a>
or &quot;<a HREF="#netconnect">Network Configuration</a>&quot;
for instructions on how to make Sequin &quot;network-aware&quot;. When
connected to the Internet, Sequin also allows you to download a record from
Entrez. If you are the original submitter of this record, you can use Sequin
to edit the sequence or add further annotations to the record.

<p align="left">
<font size=4>
<b><i>Submitting Authors Form</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
The pages in the <b>Submitting Authors</b> form ask you to provide the release
date, a working title, names and contact information of submitting authors,
and affiliation information. To create a personal template for use in future
submissions, use the <b>File/Export</b> option after completing each page of
this form.

<p align="justify">
The <b>Submission</b> page asks for a tentative title for a manuscript
describing the sequence and will initially mark the manuscript as being
unpublished. When the article is published, the database staff will update the
sequence record with the new citation. This page also lets you indicate that a
record should be held until it is published, although the preferred policy is
to release the record immediately into the public databases.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn02.png" align=bottom alt="Submission page defaults
allow immediate release of the record.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
The <b>Contact</b> page asks for the name, phone number, and email address of
the person responsible for making the submission. Database staff members will
contact this person if there are any questions about the record.

<p align="justify">
The Sfx (suffix) field should be filled with personal name suffixes (e.g.,
Jr., Sr., or 3rd), not with a person's academic degrees (e.g., MD or PhD). And
it is not necessary to type periods after initials or suffixes.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn03.png" align=bottom alt="Contact page has fields for
contact person's Name, Phone, Fax, and Email.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
In the <b>Authors</b> page, enter the names of the people who should get
scientific credit for the sequence presented in this record. These will become
the authors for the initial (unpublished) manuscript.

<p align="justify">
Authors are entered in a spreadsheet. As soon as anything is typed in the last
row, a new (blank) row is added below it. Use the tab key to move between
fields. Tabbing from the Sfx (suffix) column automatically moves to the First
Name column in the next row. Again, suffix is for personal suffixes (e.g., Jr.
or Sr.), not academic degrees.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn04.png" align=bottom alt="Authors page has a spreadsheet
for entering an arbitrary number of authors.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
The <b>Affiliation</b> page asks for the institutional affiliation of the
primary author.

<br>

<p align="left">
<font size=4>
<b><i>Sequence Format Form</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
With Sequin, the actual sequence data are imported from an outside data file.
So before you begin, prepare your sequence data files using a text editor,
perhaps one associated with your laboratory sequence analysis software
(see &quot;<a HREF="#before">Before you Begin</a>&quot;).

<p align="justify">
The traditional submission is of a <b>single nucleotide sequence</b>
containing one or more genes and encoding one or more proteins. Data files
should be prepared in FASTA format. <b>Segmented sequences</b>, e.g., where
several exons have been sequenced but the complete introns are not yet
sequenced, may also be submitted, with the individual nucleotide segments in
FASTA format combined into one file.

<p align="justify">
Sequin will also accept <b>population</b>, <b>phylogenetic</b>, or <b>mutation
studies</b>, and <b>environmental samples</b>, in which genes from many
individuals or organisms are sequenced. The data for these can be entered in
FASTA format, but they can also be entered in Contiguous or Interleaved formats
(e.g., PHYLIP, NEXUS, MACAW, or FASTA+GAP), which contain alignment information
as well as the sequences. For this example, FASTA format will be used.

<p align="justify">
The <b>batch submission</b> choice is provided to accommodate submission of
unrelated sequences, where no alignment is present or should be calculated.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn06.png" align=bottom alt="Sequence Format form has controls
for choosing the submission type and sequence data format.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
One powerful feature of Sequin is that the program can automatically annotate
the name of the organism, strain, gene, protein product, and other information
on your sequence and coding regions. You can supply this information in the
FASTA definition line between square brackets, e.g., [organism=Mus musculus]
[strain=BALB/c] for the nucleotide and [gene=ins] [protein=insulin] for the
protein.

<p align="justify">
<b>It is much easier to produce the final submission if you let Sequin work
for you in this manner.</b>

<p align="left">
<font size=4>
<b><i>Organism and Sequences Form</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
The first page of this form requests information regarding the scientific name
of the organism from which the sequence was derived, if it was not already
encoded in the nucleotide FASTA file. Organism information is most easily
entered by selecting the appropriate organism from the scrollable list. As you
begin typing the scientific name, the list will jump to the right alphabetical
location. Click on the list to finish the selection.

<p align="justify">
Once you select an organism from the list, the corresponding scientific and
common names and genetic code are filled out automatically. If you then choose
Mitochondrion as the sequence location, the alternative genetic code for that
organism will be used. If your organism is not on the list, Sequin will simply
accept the scientific name you have typed; you should then manually set the
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Taxonomy/wprintgc?mode=c">
genetic code</a> used for translation. This will later be verified by the
database staff using a more complete taxonomic database. (Sequin only holds
the top 800 organisms, whereas more than 40,000 are actually present in
GenBank.)

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn07.png" align=bottom alt="Organism page has fields for
Scientific Name, Location of Sequence, and Genetic Code for Translation">
<br>

<p align="justify">
Note: For phylogenetic studies, you may annotate each FASTA definition line
with [organism=<i>scientific name</i>] information
(see &quot;<a HREF="#before">Before you Begin</a>&quot;),
and you would not need to fill in the <b>Organism</b> page. When phylogenetic
study has been selected as the sequence format, in fact, this page is replaced
by a notice explaining how to place the organism name in the definition line.
In that case, you should enter the location of the sequence and the default
genetic code. Similarly, in a single sequence, if you embed [organism=<i>scientific
name</i>] in the definition line (usually along with other modifiers, such as
strain or clone), you can skip this page.

<p align="left">
<b>Importing Nucleotide FASTA Files</b>

<p align="justify">
To import the nucleotide sequence data, click on the <b>Nucleotide</b> folder
tab or the <b>Next Page</b> button to advance to the next page. Select
molecule type and topology, check any additional boxes that apply, then click
on <b>Import Nucleotide FASTA</b> and select the appropriate file.

<p align="justify">
It is most convenient to place the multiple segments of a segmented sequence,
or the individual sequences of a population, phylogenetic, or mutation study,
in a single file. However, they can also be kept in separate files. In this
case you would repeat the import step for each file. (In addition to importing
from a file, sequences can also be read by pasting from the computer's
&quot;clipboard&quot;.)

<p align="justify">
When the sequence file import is complete, a box will appear showing the
number of nucleotide segments imported, the total length in nucleotides of the
sequences entered, and the local ID(s) you designated. The actual sequence
data are <b>not</b> shown. If any of this information is missing or incorrect,
check the file containing the sequence data for proper FASTA format, choose
Clear from the <b>Edit</b> menu, then reimport the sequence(s).

<p align="justify">
The format for annotating the nucleotide FASTA definition line is shown below:

<pre>
>ID [organism=scientific name] [strain=strain name] title
</pre>

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn08.png" align=bottom alt="Nucleotide page has controls
for Molecule, Topology, and Incomplete at 5 prime or 3 prime end.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
Sequin has extracted the organism and strain names from the FASTA definition
line in this example, eliminating the need to fill out the <b>Organism</b>
page.

<p align="left">
<b>Importing Protein FASTA Files</b>

<p align="justify">
If you have specified a single sequence or segmented nucleotide sequence, and
if it encodes one or more proteins, you can enter the sequences of the protein
products in this page. To import the amino acid sequence, click on the
<b>Proteins</b> folder tab and proceed in the same manner as for nucleotide
data.

<p align="justify">
In this example, we imported two protein sequences. These are the alternative
splice products of the same gene. Both protein sequences were in the same data
file, but each had its own definition line with its own unique local ID.

<p align="justify">
The format for annotating the protein FASTA definition line is shown below:

<pre>
>ID [gene=gene name] [protein=protein name] title
</pre>

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn09.png" align=bottom alt="Proteins page has controls
for Incomplete at amino or carboxy end.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
Sequin has extracted the gene and protein names from the FASTA definition
lines, and will use these to construct the initial sequence record.

<p align="left">
<b>Annotating Population/Phylogenetic/Mutation/Environmental Sets</b>

<p align="justify">
If you have specified a population, phylogenetic, or mutation study or
environmental sample, the
<b>Annotation</b> folder tab replaces the <b>Proteins</b> folder tab. This
page allows you to add an rRNA or CDS feature to the entire length of all
sequences in the set. In addition, you can add a title to any sequences that
didn't obtain them from a FASTA definition line. It is much easier to add
these in bulk at this step than to add individual rRNA or CDS features to each
sequence after the record is constructed.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn10.png" align=bottom alt="Annotation page has controls
for adding Gene, rRNA, or CDS features to all sequences.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
It is customary in a nucleotide record to format titles for sequences
containing coding region features in the following way:

<p align="justify">
Genus species protein name (gene symbol) mRNA/gene, complete/partial cds.

<p align="justify">
The choice of &quot;mRNA&quot; or &quot;gene&quot; depends upon the molecule
type (use &quot;mRNA&quot; for mRNA or cDNA, and &quot;gene&quot; for genomic
DNA). Use &quot;partial&quot; for incomplete features. The proper organism
name in a phylogenetic study can be added to the beginning of each title
automatically by checking the <b>Prefix title with organism name</b> box.

<p align="justify">
However, for records containing with CDS, rRNA, or tRNA features, Sequin can
generate the definition line automatically by computing on the features
(see &quot;<a HREF="#autodefline">Generating the Definition Line</a>&quot;).

<p align="justify">
More complex situations, such as a population study of HIV sequences, can
include multiple CDS features in each sequence. In this case, do not use the
<b>Annotation</b> page to create features. (You can still use it for a common
title, however.) After the initial submission has been created, you would
manually annotate features onto one of the sequences. Feature propagation
through an alignment can then be used to annotate the same features at the
equivalent locations on the remaining sequences.

<p align="left">
<b>Entering Gene and Protein Information</b>

<p align="justify">
In the protein FASTA definition line you can embed [gene=...] and [protein=...].
If this information was not entered in the definition line, Sequin will
display the following form for each protein sequence, allowing you to fill in
the missing information manually.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn11.png" align=bottom alt="Product form has fields for
Sequence ID, Title, Gene Symbol, Protein Name, and Comment.">
<br>

<p align="left">
<b>Entering Organism and Source Modifiers</b>

<p align="justify">
In the nucleotide FASTA definition line, you can embed [organism=<i>scientific
name</i>] and modifiers from the following list (all in the format
[<i>modifier</i>=...]):  acronym, anamorph, authority, biotype, biovar, breed,
cell-line, cell-type, chemovar, chromosome, clone, clone-lib, country,
cultivar, dev-stage, dosage, ecotype, endogenous-virus-name, forma,
forma-specialis, frequency, genotype, group, haplotype, ins-seq-name, isolate,
lab-host, lineage, map, natural-host, pathovar, plasmid-name, plastid-name,
pop-variant, segment, serogroup, serotype, serovar, sex, specimen-voucher,
strain, sub-clone, sub-group, sub-species, sub-strain, subtype, synonym,
teleomorph, tissue-lib, tissue-type, transposon-name, type, and variety, e.g.,
[organism=Homo sapiens] [cell-line=HeLa]. Some population studies are a
mixture of integrated provirus and excised virion. These can be indicated by
molecule and location qualifiers, e.g., [molecule=dna] [location=proviral] or
[molecule=rna] [location=virion]. You can also embed [moltype=genomic] or
[moltype=mRNA] to indicate from what source the molecule was isolated. If
you're unsure of which modifier to use, use [note=...], and database staff
will determine the appropriate modifier to use.

<p align="justify">
For population, phylogenetic, or mutation studies, Sequin presents a form to
allow this information to be edited (if it had been entered in the FASTA file),
or entered in the first place, before it constructs the sequence record. In
addition to organism name, you can enter any kind of source modifer in this
form.

<b>Viewing Your Submission</b>
</font>
</a>

<p align="left">
<font size=4>
<b><i>GenBank View</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
After you have completed importing the data files, Sequin will display your
full submission information in the GenBank format (or EMBL format if you chose
EMBL as the database for submission in the first form).

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn13.png" align=bottom alt="View form has controls for
Target Sequence and Display format. Default format is GenBank flatfile.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
On the basis of the information provided in your DNA and amino acid sequence
files, any coding regions will be automatically identified and annotated for
you. The figure shows only the top portion of the GenBank record, but you can
see the first of two coding region (CDS) features. The vertical bar to the
left of the paragraph indicates that the CDS has been selected by clicking
with the computer's mouse.

<p align="justify">
There are also three mRNA features (not shown in the figure) that were
generated by copying the cDNA feature intervals and editing them to include
the 5' and 3' UTRs. Also, the journal citation, originally listed as
&quot;Unpublished&quot;, has been updated now that the article has been
published. Chromosome and map information have also been added to the
biological source feature. These changes were initiated by double clicking on
the appropriate paragraphs in the GenBank display format. Finally, Sequin was
asked to <a HREF="#autodefline">generate the definition line</a> by computing
on the annotated features.

<p align="left">
<font size=4>
<b><i>Graphical View</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
To get a graphical view, use the <b>Display Format</b> pop-up menu to change
from GenBank to Graphic. Reviewing your submission in Graphic format allows you
to visually confirm expected location of exons, introns, and other features in
multiple interval coding regions. The Graphic view in our eukaryotic initiation
factor example illustrates how the coding region intervals for the two protein
products are spatially related to each other.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn14.png" align=bottom alt="Graphical view has additional
controls for Style and Scale, and displays a drawing of feature locations on
the sequence coordinate.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
The <b>Duplicate View</b> item in the <b>File</b> menu will launch a second
viewer on the record. The display format on each viewer can be independently
set, allowing you to see a graphical view and a GenBank text report
simultaneously. This is useful for getting an overall view of the features and
seeing the details of annotation.

<p align="left">
<font size=4>
<b><i>Sequence View</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
Sequence view is a static version of the sequence and alignment editor. It
shows the actual nucleotide sequence, with feature intervals annotated
directly on the sequence. Protein translations of CDS features are also shown,
as are all features shown in the graphical view. Intronic regions within
protein translations are shown as a series of tilde&nbsp;(~)&nbsp;characters.

<b>Editing and Annotating Your Submission</b>
</font>
</a>

<p align="justify">
At this point, Sequin could process your entry based on what you have entered
so far, and you could send it to your nucleotide database of choice (as set in
the initial form). However, to optimize usefulness of your entry for the
scientific community, you may want to provide additional information to
indicate biologically significant regions of the sequence. But first, save the
entry so that if you make any unwanted changes during the editing process you
can revert to the original copy.

<p align="justify">
Additional information may be in the form of Descriptors or Features.
(Descriptors are annotations that apply to an entire sequence or set of
sequences. Features are annotations that apply to a specific sequence
interval.)

<p align="justify">
Sequin provides two convenient methods to modify your entry: (1) to edit
existing information, double click on the text or graphic area you want to
modify, and Sequin will display forms requesting needed information; or (2) to
add new information, use the <b>Annotate</b> menu and select from the list of
available annotations.

<p align="left">
<font size=4>
<b><i>Sequence Editor</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
Additional sequence data can also be added using Sequin's powerful sequence
editor. Sequin will automatically adjust feature intervals when editing the
sequence. Prior to Sequin, it was usually easier to reannotate everything from
scratch when the sequence changed. But an even easier way to update sequences
is described in the following section.

<p align="left">
<font size=4>
<b><i>Updating the Sequence</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
Sequin can also read in a replacement sequence, or an overlapping sequence
extension, and perform the alignment and feature propagation calculations
necessary to adjust feature intervals, even though the individual editing
operations were not done with the sequence editor.

<p align="justify">
The <b>Update Sequence</b> submenu within the <b>Edit</b> menu has several
choices. These are for use by the original submitter of a record.

<p align="justify">
You can read a FASTA file or raw sequence file. This can be a replacement
sequence, or it can overlap the original sequence at the 5' or 3' end. After
Sequin aligns the two sequences, and you select optional parameters, the
sequence in your record is updated, with all feature intervals adjusted
properly.

<p align="justify">
You can also update with an existing sequence record that contains features.
This can be obtained from a file, or retrieved from Entrez either via an
Accession number. The latter choice requires the
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/netaware.html">
network-aware</a> version of Sequin. Once it gets the new record, Sequin
aligns the two sequences as before. This is typically used either to merge two
records that overlap, or to copy features from database records onto a new
large contig.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn16.png" align=bottom alt="Update Sequence form
displays information on how the old and new sequences align.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
The first panel shows how the two sequences align to each other.  In this
case, it is a 5' extension of the existing sequence. 400 bases are new, 70
bases overlap the old sequence, and there are 30 bases of vector on the new
sequence that do not align to the old sequence and will be trimmed off.

<p align="justify">
The second panel shows details of the 70-base aligned region. There is one
single base gap in each sequence. The total number of sequence letters plus
gap characters is the alignment length, 71 in this example. (This number was
shown between the sequence figures in the first panel.) Mismatched bases are
indicated by vertical red lines between the two sequences.

<p align="justify">
The third panel shows the actual sequence letters in the aligned region.
Clicking on a gap or mismatch in the second panel scrolls to the appropriate
place in this panel.

<p align="justify">
Before pressing Accept, you need to enter optional parameters. The alignment
relationship is calculated by Sequin, but in some cases you may want to
replace rather than extend the existing sequence. If you read in a record
with features, you need to say if you only want to replace sequence, copy
features, or do both. This control is disabled if no features were present.
If you are copying features, you can keep protein IDs (such as when merging
two existing overlapping records), and you can indicate how to treat features
that were annotated in the overlapping area of both the old and new sequence.

<p align="left">
<a name="autodefline">
<font size=4>
<b><i>Generating the Definition Line</i></b>
</font>
</a>

<p align="justify">
The <b>Generate Definition Line</b> item in the <b>Annotate</b> menu can make
the appropriate titles once the record has been annotated with features. The
general format for sequences containing coding region features is:

<p align="justify">
Genus species protein name (gene symbol) mRNA/gene, complete/partial cds.

<p align="justify">
Exceptional cases, where this automatic function is unable to generate a
reasonable definition line, will be edited by the database staff to conform to
the style conventions.

<p align="justify">
The new definition line will replace any previous title, including that
originally on the FASTA definition line.

<font size=4>
<b><i>Validation</i></b>

<p align="justify">
Once you are satisfied that you have entered all the relevant information, save
your file! Then select <b>Validate</b> under the <b>Search</b> menu. You will
either receive a message that the validation test succeeded or see a screen
listing the validation errors and warnings. Just double click on an error item
to launch the appropriate editor for making corrections. See the Sequin
<b>Help</b> text for more information on correcting errors. The validator
includes checks for such things as missing organism information, incorrect
coding region lengths, internal stop codons in coding regions, inconsistent
genetic codes, mismatched amino acids, and non-consensus splice sites.

<p align="left">
<font size=4>
<b><i>Feature Editor Design</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
Sequin uses a common structure for all feature editor forms, with (usually)
three top-level folder tabs. One folder tab page is specific to the given
feature type (biological source and publications have more). The
<b>Properties</b> and <b>Location</b> pages are common to all features. Some
of these pages may have subpages, accessed by a secondary set of smaller
folder tabs. This organization allows editors for complex data structures to
fit in a reasonably small window size. The most important information in a
given section is always presented in the first subpage.

<p align="left">
<b>Coding Region Page</b>

<p align="justify">
The coding region editor is perhaps the most complicated form in Sequin.
Within the <b>Coding Region</b> page, the <b>Product</b> subpage lets you
predict the coding region intervals from the protein sequence or translate the
protein sequence from the location. (Importing a protein sequence from a file
will also interpret the [gene=...] and [protein=...] definition line information
and automatically attempt to predict the coding region intervals.) It also
displays the genetic code used for translation and the reading frame. (Please
note that there are currently 13 different genetic codes present in Sequin.
For more information on these, see
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/">
<tt>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/</tt></a>.)

<p align="justify">
The <b>Protein</b> subpage lets you set the name (or, if not known, a
description) of the protein product. The <b>Exceptions</b> subpage allows you
to indicate translation exceptions to the normal genetic code, such as
insertion of selenocysteine, suppression of terminator codons by a suppressor
tRNA, or completion of a stop codon by poly-adenylation of an mRNA.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn18.png" align=bottom alt="Coding Region page has small
folder tabs for Product, Protein, Exceptions, and Misc. Product subpage has
controls for Genetic Code, Predict Interval, and Translate Product.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
Additional annotation on the protein product might include a leader peptide,
transmembrane regions, disulfide bonds, or binding sites. These can be added
after setting the <b>Target Sequence</b> pop-up on the sequence viewer to the
desired protein sequence. You can also launch a duplicate view, already
targeted to the appropriate protein, from the <b>Protein</b> subpage.

<p align="left">
<b>Properties Page</b>

<p align="justify">
All features have a number of fields in common. Check the <b>Partial</b> box to
indicate that the range of the feature extends beyond the length of the
sequence. (You would usually also check the 5<tt>'</tt> Partial or 3<tt>'</tt>
Partial boxes in the <b>Location</b> page.) <b>Exception</b> means that the
sequence of the protein product doesn't match the translation of the DNA
sequence because of some known biological reason (e.g., RNA editing).
<b>Evidence</b> can be experimental or non-experimental. For a coding region,
the isolation of an mRNA or cDNA in the laboratory is sufficient to justify
setting this box to <b>Experimental</b>.

<p align="justify">
In addition, nucleotide features (other than genes themselves) can reference a
gene feature. This is frequently done by overlap. (The overlapping gene will
show up on the feature as a /gene qualifier in GenBank format.) Extension of
the feature location will automatically extend the gene that is selected in
the editor. In rare cases, you may want to set a gene by cross-reference. For
example, the mRNA for the lac operon in <i>E. coli</i> could indicate the
lacIZYA gene by cross-reference, and the four coding regions would be
overlapped by the lacI, lacZ, lacY, and lacA genes.

<p align="justify">
The <b>Comment</b> subpage allows text to be associated with a feature. In
GenBank format, this appears as a /note qualifier. The <b>Citations</b>
subpage attaches citations to the feature. (The citations should first be
added to the record using items in the <b>Publication</b> submenu of the
<b>Annotate</b> menu, whereupon it will appear in the REFERENCE section.) For
example, an article that justifies a non-obvious or controversial biological
conclusion would be cited here. In GenBank format, for example, if the
publication is listed as Reference 2, the feature citation appears as
/citation=[2]. <b>Cross-Refs</b> are cross-references to other databases. The
contents of this subpage may only be changed by the GenBank, EMBL, or DDBJ
database staff.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn19.png" align=bottom alt="Properties page has small
folder tabs for General, Comment, Citations, and Cross-Refs. General page
has controls for Partial, Pseudo, Evidence, Exception, and Explanation.">
<br>

<p align="left">
<b>Location Page</b>

<p align="justify">
All features are required to have a location, i.e., one or more intervals on a
sequence coordinate. The <b>Location</b> page provides a spreadsheet for
entering and editing this information. An arbitrary number of lines can be
entered. In this coding region example, the intervals correspond to the exons.
For an mRNA, the intervals would be the exons and UTRs. The 5<tt>'</tt>
Partial and 3<tt>'</tt> Partial check boxes will show up as &lt; or &gt; in
front of a feature coordinate in the GenBank flatfile, indicating partial
locations.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn20.png" align=bottom alt="Location page has controls for
5 prime Partial and 3 partial Partial, and a spreadsheet for entering an arbitrary
number of intervals.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
The GenBank flatfile view of this location would be:

<pre>
join(201..224,1550..1920,1986..2085,2317..2404,2466..2629)
</pre>

<p align="justify">
If the <b>5' Partial</b> or <b>3' Partial</b> boxes were checked, < and >
symbols would appear at the appropriate end of the join statement:

<pre>
join(<201..224,1550..1920,1986..2085,2317..2404,2466..>2629)
</pre>

<p align="justify">
If the sequence was reverse complemented (based on a length of 2881
nucleotides), the <b>Strand</b> popups would all indicate <b>Minus</b>, and
the join statement for the resulting feature location would be as follows:

<pre>
complement(join(253..416,478..565,797..896,962..1332, 2658..2681))
</pre>

<b><i>NCBI DeskTop</i></b>
</font>

<p align="justify">
The NCBI DeskTop is a window that directly displays the internal structure of
the record being viewed in Sequin. It can be understood as a Venn diagram. It
is only meant for advanced users.

<p align="justify">
As with other views on a record, the DeskTop indicates selected items and
lets you select items by clicking. Selected items can then be the target of
actions chosen from the <b>Filter </b>menu. Drag and drop can be used to add,
rearrange, or remove items in a record.

<p align="justify">
In this example, Sequin was given the genomic nucleotide, cDNA, and protein
sequences for Drosophila eukaryotic initiation factor 4E. It then determined
the mRNA and coding region intervals and built an initial structure. The
organism (BioSource descriptor) is at the nuc-prot set and thus applies to
both the nucleotide and protein sequences.

<b><i>Network Configuration</i></b>
</font>
</a>

<p align="justify">
When first downloaded, Sequin runs in stand-alone mode, without access to the
network. However, the program can also be configured to exchange information
with the NCBI (GenBank) over the Internet. The network-aware mode of Sequin is
identical to the stand-alone mode, but it contains some additional
useful options.

<p align="justify">
Sequin can only function in its network-aware mode if the computer on which
it resides has a direct Internet connection. Electronic mail access to the
Internet is insufficient. In general, if you can install and use a WWW browser
on your system, you should be able to install and use network-aware Sequin.
Check with your system administrator or Internet provider if you are uncertain
as to whether you have direct Internet connectivity.

<p align="justify">
To launch the configuration form, select Net Configure under the Misc menu,
from either the initial Welcome to Sequin form or from a viewer on an existing
sequence record.

<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/seqn22.png" align=bottom alt="Network Configuration form has
buttons for Normal, Firewall, or No Connection.">
<br>

<p align="justify">
If you are not behind a firewall, set the <b>Connection</b> control to
<b>Normal</b>. If you also have a Domain Name Server (DNS) available, you can
now simply press <b>Accept</b>.

<p align="justify">
If DNS is not available, uncheck the <b>Domain Name Server</b> button. If you
are behind a firewall, set the <b>Connection</b> control to <b>Firewall</b>.
The <b>Proxy</b> box then becomes active. If you also use a proxy server, type
in its address. (If you have DNS, it will be of the form
<tt>www.myproxy.myuniversity.edu</tt>. If you do not have DNS, you should use
the numerical IP address of the form <tt>127.45.23.6</tt>.) Once you type
something in the <b>Proxy</b> box, the <b>Port</b> box and <b>Transparent
Proxy</b> button become active and can be filled in or changed as appropriate.
(By default the <b>Transparent Proxy</b> button is off, indicating a CERN-like
proxy.) Ask your network administrator for advice on the proper settings to
use.

<p align="justify">
If you are in the United States, the default <b>Timeout</b> of 30 seconds
should suffice. From foreign countries with poor Internet connection to the
U.S., you can select up to 5 minutes as the timeout.

<p align="justify">
Finally, you will need to quit and restart Sequin ifor the network-aware
settings to take effect.

<p align="justify">
If you are behind a firewall, it must be configured correctly to access NCBI
services. Your network administrator may have done this already. If not,
please have them contact NCBI for further instructions on setting up firewalls
to work with NCBI services.

<p align="justify">
<b>The following section is intended for network administrators:</b>

<p align="justify">
Using NCBI services from behind a security firewall requires opening ports in
your firewall. Please consult
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/NETWORK/firewall.html">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/NETWORK/firewall.html</a>
for the list of current hosts and ports that have the firewall
daemon configured.

<p align="justify">
If your firewall is not transparent, the firewall port number
should be mapped to the same port number on the external host.

<p align="justify">
Note: Old NCBI clients used different application configuration settings and
ports than listed above. If you need to support such clients, which are
becoming obsolete, please contact <a href="mailto:info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">

For alignment formats, such as NEXUS, do not use the ? character to

Ambiguous bases should be indicated as IUPAC characters such as N.

<b><i>Feature Table Format</i></b>
</font>
</a>

<p align="justify">
Sequin can now annotate features by reading in a tab-delimited table. This is
most often used by genome centers that store feature interval information in
relational databases or spreadsheets. For most submitters, it is usually
better to supply protein sequences in FASTA format with gene and protein names
embedded in the definition line.

<p align="justify">
The feature table specifies the location and type of each feature, and Sequin
processes the feature intervals and translates any CDSs. The table is read in
the record viewer (after the sequence has been imported) using the File-->Open
menu item. The table must follow a defined format. The first line starts with
>Feature, a space, and then the Sequence ID of the sequence you are
annotating. In the example below, eIF4E is the Sequence ID, and it is a local
identifier.

<p align="justify">
The table is composed of five columns: start, stop, feature key, qualifier
key, and qualifier value. The columns are separated by tabs. The first row for
any given feature has start, stop, and feature key. Additional feature
intervals just have start and stop. The qualifiers follow on lines starting
with three tabs.

Note that if the gene feature spans the intervals of the CDS and mRNA features
for that gene, you don't need to include gene "qualifiers" in those features,
because they will be picked up by overlap.

<p align="justify">
Features that are on the complementary strand are indicated by reversing the
interval locations. For example, the table:

<pre>
>Features lcl|dna2
5284    5202    tRNA
                        product  tRNA-Glu
</pre>

<p align="justify">
will result in a GenBank flatfile containing:

<pre>
     tRNA            complement(5202..5284)
                     /product="tRNA-Glu"
</pre>
