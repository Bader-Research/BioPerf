Pre-release 1 of version 4.2 of SOCKS.CSTC, dated June 30, 1994

-Made consistent use of u_int32 for alpha port. (David Mischel)

-Included partial port (server and library) for NextStep 3.2. (William Lewis)

-Made clients behave like non-SOCKSified programs if /etc/socks.conf
 is absent.

-Made the printing of client banner controllable using environment
 variable SOCKS_BANNER. (Bryan Curnutt)

-Added compile-time option to disable syslog from clients. (Jason Baietto)

-Added DNS_THROUGH_NIS in Makefile to accomodate sites which resolve
 DNS through their NIS server and have no local /etc/resolv.conf.

-Include bsdinstall, a shell script written by Phil Hochstetler,
 phil@sequent.com, which simulate BSD's install for SYSV systems. 

=======================================
Beta release of version 4.2 of SOCKS.CSTC, dated March 21, 1994

-Added code to allow use of filenames in the *=userlist field.
 The filenames must be a complete path (starting with /). Userids
 and comments can be used in such files. Updated the man pages
 sockd.conf.5 and soccks.conf.5 to document the new feature.

-Merged in code to show sockd's usage details in the output of
 ps commamd. Only work with non-SYSV hosts. (Matt Cohen)

========================================
Beta release of version 4.2 of SOCKS.CSTC, dated February 22, 1994

-Corrected mistakes in determining privileged/non-privileged port.

-Dereferenced addr in saddrtoname.c. (Anthony Starks)

-Added code to zero out all sockaddr_in structures before using them.
 (Carlos Mora)

-Added code to treat IP address 0.0.0.0 as localhost. (Anthony Shipman)

-Added code to save host and port after a successful direct connect.
 (Ian Dunkin)

-Made the facility and the log levels for syslog configurable in
 socks.h. (Jon Luini)

-Made the optimization flag for cc configurable in Makefile. (Craig Metz)

-Made SendDst() and GetDst() quit when write() or read() returns 0.
 (David Nochlin)

-Added code to use iotcl(...,FIOSSAIOOWN...) in place of
 fcntl(...F_SETOWN...) for hpux. (John Brezak)

=======================================
Beta release of version 4.2 of SOCKS.CSTC, dated February 9, 1994.

Changes since release 4.1

1) Merged in SCO/ODT 2.x and BSDi v1.0 ports by Chris Riney.

2) Merged in PS/2 AIX 1.2.1 port by Craig Metz.

3) Merged in DEC OSF 1.3 port by Alain Mellan.

4) Merged in the code to prevent premature closing of a TCP session
   on the SOCKS server when the server is much faster than the
   client host. Contributed by Andy McFadden.

5) Merged in the code for using environment variable SOCKS_DNAME
   to override the setting of SOCKS_DEFAULT_DNAME. Contributed by
   Jon Luini.

6) It handles non-blocking connect() call correctly, at least for
   the way non-blocking connect()'s are done in Mosaic 2.1. This
   necessitates the addition of Rselect() to the library.

7) You can build libsocks.a with Rbind() which accepts the same
   calling sequence as regular bind(), i.e., without the extra
   last argument.

8) Call to SOCKSinit() is made optional.

9) Rrcmd() is optionally added to the library.

The combined effect of 6) through 9) is that, for most applications,
you can do the SOOCKSification without doing anything to the code
at all. Just add

-Dconnect=Rconnect -Dbind=Rbind -Dgetsockname=Rgetsockname -Dlisten=Rlisten -Daccept=Raccept -Drcmd=Rrcmd -Dselect=Rselect

to cc and make sure the appropraite SOCKS library is used in linking.
I hope this will encourage developers to produce SOCKSified version
of their applications. (By the way, if you really want that, you should
certainly make the effort of letting your friendly software vendors
or developers know about it. Customers's demands count a great deal
in the software market.)

10) In anticipation of client hosts that can't run identd, a new
   filed '?=n' is added to the control line for sockd.conf. This
   enables the use of invoking sockd with -I option to use identd
   in general but have it turned off for some specific client hosts.
   (You can also use '?=I' or '?=i' to turn identd on for a line, I
   just see the use of '?=n' as more likely.)

11) Deliver out-of-band data end to end.

12) Connection to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) is always direct. No more
   need to specify that in /etc/socks.conf.
